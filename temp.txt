Subject: Request for Leave

Hi Adam,

Apologies for the late notice, but my in-laws have been experiencing health issues recently. My wife and I would like to visit them. May I take 5 days off next week, starting from the 22nd of July?

Please let me know if this is okay so that I can book the flight tickets.

Thanks,
Shanto
